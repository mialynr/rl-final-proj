# CS 285 Final Project

This is the repo used for my CS 285 (Reinforcement Learning) Fall 2023 project, "Improving Outcomes for Agents in Disadvantaged Situations". Here, I probe the effects of certain disadvantageous fixed attributes using OpenAI Gym HalfCheetah simulator. Most code of the code relies on course dependencies that should be included in the respective folders.

The resulting paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMvuIpRQF1UZrt1UQ55HDYBsr0rJ4oCl/view?usp=sharing).
