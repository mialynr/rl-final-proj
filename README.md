# Improving Outcomes for Agent in Disadvantaged Situations

This is the repo for my CS 285 (Reinforcement Learning) project, "Improving Outcomes for Agent in Disadvantaged Situations." 

Due to direct modifications to OpenAI Gym, most of this project is hosted under the branch `gym-update`. Please check the branch to see code; otherwise, feel free to read the report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMvuIpRQF1UZrt1UQ55HDYBsr0rJ4oCl/view?usp=sharing)!
