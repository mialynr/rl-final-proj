# CS 285 Final Project

This is the repo used for my CS 285 (Reinforcement Learning) Fall 2023 project, "Improving Outcomes for Agents in Disadvantaged Situations". Here, I probe the effects of certain disadvantageous fixed attributes using OpenAI Gym HalfCheetah simulator.

The resulting paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMvuIpRQF1UZrt1UQ55HDYBsr0rJ4oCl/view?usp=sharing).
